Customer Churn Prediction
Overview
Customer churn is a critical challenge for businesses, as retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques. The insights derived from this project can help businesses proactively address customer retention.

Project Workflow
Problem Definition

Objective: Predict whether a customer will churn based on their demographics, usage patterns, and account information.
Dataset: Telco Customer Churn dataset.
Data Cleaning

Removed irrelevant columns.
Handled missing values and converted categorical data into numerical format.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized churn distribution and feature correlations.
Identified key factors influencing churn.
Feature Engineering

Scaled numerical features for better model performance.
Encoded categorical variables.
Model Building

Used a Random Forest Classifier for prediction.
Evaluated the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Deployment (Optional)

Created a simple web app using Flask to predict churn for new customers.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
Deployment: Flask (optional)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-churn-prediction.git
cd customer-churn-prediction
Install the required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the project folder.

Run the Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
(Optional) To run the Flask app:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook and follow the step-by-step implementation to explore the dataset, train the model, and evaluate performance.
Use the Flask app to input customer data and predict churn.
Results
Achieved an accuracy of XX% and an ROC-AUC score of XX.
Key insights:
Customers with shorter tenures are more likely to churn.
Certain services (e.g., streaming) significantly impact churn rates.
